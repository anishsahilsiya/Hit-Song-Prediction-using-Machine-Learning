# Hit Song Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the 'Hit Song Prediction using Machine Learning' project! This project is an in-depth analysis of Spotify API data focusing on songs from the Billboard Top 100. Our team of four has conducted a comprehensive study to predict hit songs using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can identify potential hit songs based on various musical features and historical data. The project leverages data obtained from the Spotify API, specifically focusing on songs that have featured in the Billboard Top 100.

## Key Features

- Data Collection: Extracted data on top songs from the Spotify API.
- Feature Engineering: Identified and prepared relevant features for model training.
- Model Comparison: Evaluated four different supervised learning algorithms.
- Best Model: Achieved a precision of 72% with the Random Forest model.
- Model Validation: Validated model performance using a comprehensive confusion matrix analysis.

## Technologies Used

- Python for data processing and model development
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Spotify API for data collection
- Random Forest for the final predictive model

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- Access to Spotify API

### Installation

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/anishsahilsiya/Hit-Song-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning.git`

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebooks in the repository to see the data analysis and model training steps. The final model can be used to predict the hit potential of new songs by inputting their features.
